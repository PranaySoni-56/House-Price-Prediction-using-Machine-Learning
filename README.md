# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, population, median income, and more. The model is trained on real-world housing data and aims to provide accurate price estimations, which can be valuable for homeowners, real estate agents, and potential buyers.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing:
Efficient data cleaning and transformation techniques, including log transformations and handling categorical variables with dummy encoding.

Feature Engineering:
Creation of insightful features like bedroom-to-room ratio and household-to-room ratio to capture deeper relationships in the data.

Model Selection:
Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to identify the best-performing model.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Utilized GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters and improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics:
Performance measured using RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
